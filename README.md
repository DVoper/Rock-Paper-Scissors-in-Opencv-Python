# Rock-Paper-Scissors | Opencv-Python
Making a Rock-Paper-Scissors game in python using Opencv-Python,cvzone and numpy isn't hard.
All you got to do is to create a file named "RPS" and upload 3 images(I will provide this file).
Then with just 340 lines of python you can easily do this.



The Images were developed and resized in canva(canva.com).

The installations are as follows:


pip install opencv-python==4.2.0.32


pip install numpy==1.19.5


pip install cvzone==1.3.5


Thank You!!!
